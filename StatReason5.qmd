Welcome! This is the fifth statistical reasoning activity. The goals of this activity are to understand how to implement and interpret *interactive* models (of multiple regression).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will submit one output for this activity:

1.  A **PDF** of a rendered Quarto document with all of your R code. Please create a new Quarto document (e.g. don't use this `README.qmd`) and include all of the code that appears in this document, your own code, and **answers to all of the questions** in the "Q#" sections. Submit this PDF through Gradescope.

A reminder: **Please label the code** in your final submission in two ways:

1.  denote your answers to each question using headers that correspond to the question you're answering, and
2.  thoroughly "comment" your code: remember, this means annotating your code directly by typing descriptions of what each line does after a `#`. This will help future you!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Interactions

Back when we introduced multiple regression in "Activity 10: Statistical Reasoning 2 - multiple regression" we looked at the Palmer Penguins dataset. Included in that activity was this paragraph describing additive models:

> **This is an additive model**, which means that that the effect of one predictor is treated as independent of other predictors. Rephrased, this means that this model structure assumes that the effect of bill length on bill depth *will not differ between species*. If we think of this graphically, it means that this model forces each species to have the exact same slope. In our example, this seems like a fine assumption: in the graph above, notice that the slopes that geom_smooth() puts on the graph are basically parallel (parallel lines = equal slopes). If we feel that the slope should actually be different for each species, then we would use an *interactive model* instead of an *additive model*, but don't worry about that - we'll get to that later in the quarter!

Guess what? It's later in the quarter!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interactions occur when one the value of one predictor variable influences the effect of a second predictor on the response. Now, one predictor is *conditional* on another. For instance, imagine that for one species of penguin, increasing body mass leads to longer bills, while for a second species, increasing body mass leads to smaller bills. Is there a general effect of body mass on bill length? No, because it's *conditional*: if species A, then it's a positive effect, but if species B, it's negative. Lots of ecology is like this: "It depends!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conceptual questions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q1.1 Describe the interaction in the comic

In this XKCD comic below, `productivity` is a function of the interaction between `power outage` (pre vs post outage) and the `reliance on internet for work`. In 1-2 sentences, describe how the power outage interacts with the reliance on internet to affect productivity.

![XKCD service outage](pictures/xkcd-3170-service-outage.png)

1.1 A: Internet service outages have a varying effect on productivity. Productivity is conditional on whether the user relies on internet to be productive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q1.2 What additional variable would lead to an interaction?

For each of the causal relationships below, name a hypothetical third variable that would lead to an interaction effect and describe what the effect would be. For instance, what would cause the effect of e.g. yeast on the rate of bread rising to increase/decrease?

-   Bread dough rises because of yeast.
    -   Temperature would impact the rate of dough rise.
-   Education leads to higher income.
    -   Could be dependent on the education received and the focus of the major.
-   Gasoline makes a car go.
    -   Dependent on the presence or absence of an ICE engine. Gas does not an electric vehicle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Penguins

We're going to continue working with the Palmer penguins data to illustrate how to interpret interactive models. Let's set up:

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # For data wrangling
library(brms) # For stats
library(palmerpenguins) # For the data
library(ggeffects) # for plotting model predictions
```

```{r}
# Store the data as penguins
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins
```

```{r}
# Look at the column names
penguins %>% colnames()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q1.3 Filter the dataset to only include Adelie and Chinstrap penguins

Let's make our lives simple today by only looking at two species: filter the `penguins` dataset to only include Adelie and Chinstrap penguins. Use the functions that we learned in the first half of the quarter. Store the new dataframe as `penguins.AC`

```{r}
df <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species != 'Gentoo')
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q1.4 Make a plot of flipper length \~ body mass and species

Using ggplot and geom_smooth, make a plot of flipper length on the y axis with body mass on the x, and color the points by species. Put a geom_smooth() line on top of the points with a "linear model" (lm) line.

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(y = flipper_length_mm, x = body_mass_g, colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q1.5 Describe the relationships

Describe in 1-2 sentences whether you think the relationship you see is interactive or additive. In other words, do you think that the effect of body mass on flipper length is conditional on species? Why do you think this?

It looks like like the relationship between body mass on flipper length is conditional on species. The slopes for each species is different, so there seems to be an interactive effect of species and body mass on flipper length. This could be because of differences in life history strategies that result in different physiological responses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Additive model - categorical + continuous

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q1.6 Run and assess an additive model

Run and assess an additive model of `flipper_length_mm ~ 0 + species + body_mass_g` (the zero allows will provide separate intercepts for each species). Store the model output as `m.flip.mass.spp.additive`

In your assessment, describe whether or not you think the model ran well.

It looks like the

```{r}
m.flip.mass.spp.additive <- brm(flipper_length_mm ~ 0 + species + body_mass_g, df)

summary(m.flip.mass.spp.additive)
plot(m.flip.mass.spp.additive)
```

It looks like the model ran well. There are unimodal peaks and the chains are overlapping with no trend. Rhat is 1 as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's plot the additive model's predictions. Remember, the additive model does not allow for the two effects to interact. Graphically, this means that it does not allow the slope of one effect to change with another effect.

```{r eval=FALSE}
preds.add <- predict_response(m.flip.mass.spp.additive,
                          terms = c("body_mass_g", "species"))

plot(preds.add, show_data = TRUE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q1.7 Interpret the additive model

Interpret the additive model output; in a few sentences, answer:

1.  Which species has longer flippers, and by how much?
    1.  Chinstrap species has longer flippers and by 5.6mm
2.  What is the effect of body mass on flipper length (remember units), and is that effect consistent with zero?
    2.  For every 1 g of body mass flipper length increases by 0.01mm. That effect is not consistent with zero.
3.  Given the additive model, does the effect of body mass on flipper length vary per species?
    3.  Conditional on this being an additive model, there is no effect of body mass on flipper length by species. The additive model prevents any interactive effect of species.

Something I learned this week is that you can print out more decimal places in the model output by using the print() function instead of the summary() function (at least for brms model outputs):

`print(model.name, digits = 4`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Interactive model - categorical + continuous

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's try an interactive model! As in the lecture, we are going to write this with "non-linear syntax" within the `bf()` function where our model normally goes.

```{r}
# flipper length by body mass and species - INTERACTIVE model
m.flip.mass.spp.interactive <- 
  brm(data = df, # Give the model the penguins data
      # Choose a gaussian (normal) distribution
      family = gaussian,
      # Specify the model here. 
      # First, we write the equation with a as an intercept and b as a slope next to body mass
      bf(flipper_length_mm ~ 0 + a + b*body_mass_g,
         # Then, we specify that we want our intercept, a, to vary with species
         a ~ 0 + species,
         # Next, we specify that we want our slope, b, to ALSO vary with species 
         # (this is the interaction part!!)
         b ~ 0 + species,
         # Lastly, we tell it that we are writing in a particular notation
         nl = TRUE),
      # Here's where you specify parameters for executing the Markov chains
      # We're using similar to the defaults, except we set cores to 4 so the analysis runs faster than the default of 1
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      # Setting the "seed" determines which random numbers will get sampled.
      # In this case, it makes the randomness of the Markov chain runs reproducible 
      # (so that both of us get the exact same results when running the model)
      seed = 4,
      # Save the fitted model object as output - helpful for reloading in the output later
      file = "output/m.flip.mass.spp.interactive")
```

```{r}
# Print out the model output with 4 digits to avoid the display rounding to zero
print(m.flip.mass.spp.interactive, digits = 4)
```

We now have four terms in our model: - an intercept (`a`) for Adelie (165.2524) - an intercept (`a`) for Chinstrap (151.0668) - a slope (`b`) for Adelie (0.0067) - a slope (`b`) for Chinstrap (0.0120)

It looks like both of our slopes are different from zero; the flipper length-body mass relationship for Adelie is 0.0067mm/g (95%CI from 0.0047-0.0086) while for Chinstrap it's nearly doubled at 0.0120mm/g (95%CI from 0.0084-0.0158).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Plot posteriors

Are the two slopes different from one another? If you look at the 95% CIs, the ranges barely overlap: Adelie goes from 0.0047-0.0086 while Chinstrap goes from 0.0084-0.0158. We can look at the distributions of the posterior estimates via the plot function that we use to assess the model:

```{r}
plot(m.flip.mass.spp.interactive)
```

However, it's hard to tell how much the distributions for the two slopes overlap though, because the scales are different. Here's some fun code to extract the raw posterior values that went into this plot and make our own plot with the estimates side-by-side:

```{r}
# Store posterior parameter estimates
model_posterior_samples <- as_draws_df(m.flip.mass.spp.interactive)

# Wrangle and then plot samples for the slopes (b) specifically
model_posterior_samples %>% 
  # Select the columns we care about (exclude the posterior estimates for the intercepts and sigma)
  dplyr::select(b_b_speciesAdelie, b_b_speciesChinstrap) %>% 
  # Pivot to long format for easy ggplotting
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
               names_to = "parameter",
               values_to = "estimate") %>%
  # Plot as a two overlapping histograms, with the fill colored by parameter
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, fill = parameter)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.55, color = "black",
                 # position = "identity" makes the histograms overlay each other instead of stack
                 position = "identity") +
  xlim(0, NA)

```

There is only a bit each distribution that overlap, so I feel confident that the estimates are different, and thus we have two different slopes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Plot model predictions

Let's plot our model predictions:

```{r}
preds.int <- predict_response(m.flip.mass.spp.interactive,
                          terms = c("body_mass_g", "species"))

plot(preds.int, show_data = TRUE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q1.8 Which model has better predictive power?

Using what you learned last week, which model (additive vs interactive) has better predictive power? Back your answer up with PSIS and WAIC values.

```{r}
loo(m.flip.mass.spp.interactive)
waic(m.flip.mass.spp.interactive)

loo(m.flip.mass.spp.additive)
waic(m.flip.mass.spp.additive)
```

A1.8: From the PSIS and WAIC values, The interactive model is better for both PSIS and WAIC. For PSIS the additive model is 1395.1 and the interactive is 1390.6. For WAIC the additive is 1395.0 and the interactive is 1390.5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Do it yourself

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now it's your turn to run an *interactive* model. Using the df filtered dataset, model how `bill_length_mm` varies as a function of `bill_depth_mm` interacting with `species`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q2.1 Make a graph

Make a graph that reflects the model you are about to run

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q2.2 Set up and run an *interactive* model

Make sure you store your model output as something informative to you.

```{r}
# bill length by bill depth and species - INTERACTIVE model
m.blength.bdepth.spp.interactive <- 
  brm(data = df, # Give the model the penguins data
      # Choose a gaussian (normal) distribution
      family = gaussian,
      # Specify the model here. 
      # First, we write the equation with a as an intercept and b as a slope next to body mass
      bf(bill_length_mm ~ 0 + a + b*bill_depth_mm,
         # Then, we specify that we want our intercept, a, to vary with species
         a ~ 0 + species,
         # Next, we specify that we want our slope, b, to ALSO vary with species 
         # (this is the interaction part!!)
         b ~ 0 + species,
         # Lastly, we tell it that we are writing in a particular notation
         nl = TRUE),
      # Here's where you specify parameters for executing the Markov chains
      # We're using similar to the defaults, except we set cores to 4 so the analysis runs faster than the default of 1
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      # Setting the "seed" determines which random numbers will get sampled.
      # In this case, it makes the randomness of the Markov chain runs reproducible 
      # (so that both of us get the exact same results when running the model)
      seed = 4,
      # Save the fitted model object as output - helpful for reloading in the output later
      file = "output/m.blength.bdepth.spp.interactive")


```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q2.3 Assess the model

Assess whether the model ran correctly by looking at R hat, the chains, and the posterior distributions. Describe your thought process about whether the model ran correctly in 1-2 sentences.

```{r}
plot(m.flip.mass.spp.interactive)
```

The model looks like it ran correctly, Rhat is 1, chains overlap with no trend, posterior distributions unimodal and smooth.

```{r}
print(m.flip.mass.spp.interactive, digits = 4)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q2.4 Plot model predictions

Plot the model predictions using `predict_response()`

```{r}
preds.int.blength <- predict_response(m.blength.bdepth.spp.interactive,
                          terms = c("bill_depth_mm", "species"))

plot(preds.int.blength, show_data = TRUE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q2.5 Plot posteriors

Plot the model posteriors for the two slope values by adapting the code provided in the "Plot posteriors" to your current model. Ask Calvin or Malin if you need help!

```{r}
# Store posterior parameter estimates
model_posterior_samples_blength <- as_draws_df(m.blength.bdepth.spp.interactive)

# Wrangle and then plot samples for the slopes (b) specifically
model_posterior_samples_blength %>% 
  # Select the columns we care about (exclude the posterior estimates for the intercepts and sigma)
  dplyr::select(b_b_speciesAdelie, b_b_speciesChinstrap) %>% 
  # Pivot to long format for easy ggplotting
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
               names_to = "parameter",
               values_to = "estimate") %>%
  # Plot as a two overlapping histograms, with the fill colored by parameter
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, fill = parameter)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.55, color = "black",
                 # position = "identity" makes the histograms overlay each other instead of stack
                 position = "identity") +
  xlim(0, NA)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q2.6 Interpret the model

Interpret your model by answering:

1.  How does bill depth influence bill length, and how does it differ by species? Remember to describe the effect using the units to make it biologically meaningful.
    1.  bill depth influences bill length differently for each species. For Adelie a 1mm increase of bill depth, bill length increase by 0.86mm. For Chinstraps, a 1mm increases of bill depth increases bill length by 1.92mm.
2.  Does it seem like the slope estimates are different from zero? Why?
    2.  Yes the slope estimates do seem different because neither CI includes 0.
3.  Does it seem like the slope estimates are different from one another (e.g. do Adelie and Chinstrap penguins have different slopes)? Why?
    3.  Yes, Adelie slope is 0.86 while the Chinstrap is 1.92. They are also different from each other because their CI only very slightly overlap as shown in the posterior plot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q2.7 Which model has better predictive power?

Using what you learned last week, which model (additive vs interactive) has better predictive power? Back your answer up with PSIS and WAIC values.

```{r}
m.blength.bdepth.spp.additive <- brm(bill_length_mm ~ 0 + species + bill_depth_mm,  df)

```

```{r}
loo(m.blength.bdepth.spp.interactive)
loo(m.blength.bdepth.spp.additive)

```

```{r}
waic(m.blength.bdepth.spp.interactive)
waic(m.blength.bdepth.spp.additive)
```

The interactive model is better since it has lower values for both the PSIS and WAIC. For the PSIS, the additive is 1036.1, the interactive is 1026.7. For WAIC, the additive 1036.1 and the interactive is 1026.7.
